## PROBLEM: Need to create a slot machine that spins and returns 3 different numbers.
##
## ALGORITHM:
##  1) Random is imported and definitions are created for playing again, getting the users bank value, their wager value, the slot spin results, how many numbers matched and the value of their winnings.
##  2) While the user wants to play again, variables are defined and loop is started for when the users bank is greater than 0.
##  3) The users values are returned, and repeatedly ran through the random numbers until the user runs out of chips in their bank.
##  4) Once the user reaches the end and runs out of chips, then information about their rounds is printed.
##
## ERROR HANDLING: The errors I encountered were with getting the program to loop again when asked for user input, and returning values from certain definitions was difficult in some cases.
##
## OTHER COMMENTS:
